# Word Guess Game

## Instructions
1.  Choose a theme for the game.
2.  Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.
3.  Display the following on the page:
    *   Press any key to get started!
    *   The number of Wins.
    *   If the work is `madonna`, display it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.
    *   As the player guesses the correct letters, reveal them `m a d o _ _ a`.
    *   The number of guesses remaining.
    *   Letters already guessed.
4.  After the player wins or loses, the game should automatically choose another word and make the player play it.

## Bonus

1.  Play a sound or song when the player guesses the correct word.
2.  Write some stylish CSS rules to make a design that fits your game's theme.
3.  **HARD MODE:** Organize the game code as an object, except for the key events to get the letter guessed.
    *   Save the whole game and its properties in an object.
    *   Save any of the game's functions as methods, and call them under the object declaration using event listeners.
